Replacement Adapter for GT Omega PRO Keyboard Tray
----

The adapter provided for the GT Omega PRO Keyboard Tray is very weak and will break as soon as it is stressed a little too much.
This replacement comes with much thicker walls and is taller to distribute the load better.

The adapter holes are a bit wider. The idea is to apply a thin layer of tape around each rod since the replacement 
adapter has no way to add friction to the rods.

Printed in PLA, 0,25mm layer height with 25% honeycomb infill.
The inside hole tapers by 45 degress to prevent any issues when printing.
